# Linear-regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is used to predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.

In a linear regression model, the dependent variable is assumed to be a linear function of the independent variables, with a constant coefficient for each independent variable. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that describes the relationship between the dependent and independent variables, based on a given set of data.

Linear regression can be used to model relationships between two quantitative variables, as well as relationships between a quantitative variable and one or more categorical variables. It is a simple and widely used statistical method that is well suited for many applications, including predicting sales, stock prices, and other continuous variables.

Linear regression can be implemented in many programming languages, including Python, R, and others, using a variety of statistical libraries and packages.
